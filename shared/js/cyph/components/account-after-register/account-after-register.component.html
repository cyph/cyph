			As a limited-time special, we would like to offer you a $100
			Lifetime Platinum upgrade! (normally $48/mo) In addition to
			rewarding our early supporters, this will go a long way toward
			helping us improve Cyph in various ways, such as dramatically
			optimizing performance, polishing the interface, fleshing out the
			current features, and considering new features based on popular
			demand. In exchange for a one-time payment, the following will be
			added to your account:
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>File storage: 500 MB -> 1 TB</li>
			<li>
				Access to new & experimental features, like our E2EE
				cryptocurrency wallet
			</li>
			<li>
				Short username: You can bypass our minimum of 5 characters and
				register a username as short as you'd like, if you upgrade
				before registering
			</li>
			<li>
				Verification: You'll be first in line when we set up a "verified
				accounts" system like Twitter's
			</li>
			<li>
				Lifetime priority support: Email us any time at
				founders@cyph.com â€” or just add @ryan and @josh on Cyph :)
			</li>
		</ul>
