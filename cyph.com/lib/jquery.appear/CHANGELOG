0.3.3 IE8 compatibility fix.
0.3.2 Code cleanups. Appear now supports not only jQuery selectors but also raw DOM nodes wrapped in jQuery.
0.3.1 Added "disappear" event. Removed first argument (callback function) from $.fn.appear function. "appear" event is now triggered for each appeared element (before it was triggered only for a first element in selector).
